# LinkedIn_skills_scraping

From the LinkedIn Skills stored in the topics directory, the function initialises dataBases and 
crawls through the 37,000 skills and scrapes related skill metadata (popularity, related companies,
related skills and related universities). 

I intend this exercise to scrape from LinkedIn's publically hosted webpages for educational reasons.
It is shared with the community for educational purposes. Please note, I accept no responsibilty for
unfair & illegal usage of the derived data; please inheret and duely respect the data usage rules 
and regulations for each pice of data you scrape.
